1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 d6 4. Nc3 Nf6 {[pgndiagram] Some strange sort of
Philidor /Four knights game is on the board.} 5. Bb5 {And now Capa transposes
to Ruy Lopez. Don't ask me what is the name of variation, I am really confused
with the move order :D.  Probably some sort of Berlin/Steinitz defence with d6}

He doesn't have immediate problems with development or many weaknesses, but he
does have less space.} 7. Re1 (7. d5 {It is always a question whether White
wants to play this advance in similar structures} Nb8 8. Be2 O-O {And
objectively White should be better here, but Black has counterattacing chances
on the kingside and it probably didn't suit Capablanca's style.}) 7... exd4 {
[pgndiagram] Exchanging the pieces is usually in favour of player with less
space.} 8. Nxd4 Nxd4 9. Qxd4 Bxb5 10. Nxb5 {[pgndiagram] White is still
slightly better in this type of pawn structure, where White's e4 pawn faces
Black's d6 counterpart.   However, an exchange of two pairs of minor pieces is
definitely to Black's advantage. Typicaly White has attacking chances on the
kingside in similar positions and exchanges reduce his attacking potential} O-O
11. Qc3 {This move is slightly pointless} c6 $2 {But this creates a weakness
on d6 and justified White's previous move} (11... a6 {Was correct. The c7 pawn
is indirectly defended} 12. Nd4 (12. Nxc7 {Would of course be a horrible
blunder due to} Rc8) 12... Nd7 13. Nf5 Bf6 {[pgndiagram] And the difference

White's knight will feel very good on f5, hitting Black's d6 pawn and creating
threats on the kingside} Nd7 $2 {[pgndiagram] Not sensing the danger} (12...

too computerish even for today's standards, let alone for the 1918.}) 16. Rad1
Rad8 17. Rxd6 $5 {[pgndiagram] Starting a very beautiful combination that is
slightly flawed. Still, Capablanca never avoided tactics when he thought the
position required them} (17. h4 {Maintaning the tension was probably
objectively stronger, but much less fun}) 17... Rxd6 18. Bxe5 Rd1 $2 {
[pgndiagram] The problems prove to be too difficult for Fonaroff and he
commits a decisive mistake of the game} (18... Qa5 {Attacking the rook on e1,
was the way to go.} 19. Bc3 Bxc3 20. bxc3 Rg6 21. Ne7+ Kh8 22. Nxg6+ hxg6 23.

equal}) 19. Rxd1 Bxe5 {Now Capablanca finishes the game with an elegant
tactical sequence, exploiting the weakness of the back rank and the
unfortunate position of the piece on e5} 20. Nh6+ Kh8 21. Qxe5 $1 {[pgndiagram]
Forcing the Black queen on e5} Qxe5 22. Nxf7+ {[pgndiagram] And now winning a
piece, because taking with the rook is impossible due to a back rank mate. A
very attractive game by Capablanca, even if the class of the opponent was not
very high. The combination immediately became classic.} 1-0

it hands the e4 square to Black} (12. c4 {Was probably once again preferable})

the Ruy Lopez.} 9. Bc2 c5 10. d4 Qc7 11. Nbd2 Bg4 $6 {[pgndiagram] But this

retreating the bishop toward queenside.}) 12... g5 $2 {And this agression is
just plain bad, that shows that the level of understanding of similar Ruy
