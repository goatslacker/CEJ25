strange to see Alekhine choosing the quiet 3 Nf3 4 e3 continuation} e6 5. Bxc4
c5 6. O-O Nc6 7. Qe2 a6 8. Rd1 $3 {[pgndiagram] The exclamation marks are not
for the quality of the move, but for the breakthrough in time. Alekhine
realizes that he can do without a4 and immediately develops a piece} (8. a4 {
Was played almost exclusively, but this gave Black the b4 square and I don't
think that White has all that much in that variation. White players
subsequently tried other paths, but for 1931 move such as 8 Rd1 was a
revelation}) 8... b5 9. dxc5 Qc7 10. Bd3 Bxc5 11. a4 $1 {[pgndiagram] The

center and  increasing the scope of the dark squared bishop} Nd7 {Anticipating
the e5 advance, but it was better to complete the development} (14... Bb7 15.
e5 Nd7 16. Bf4 {Although even here Black's position is unpleasant, at least
his rooks are connected and all his pieces are developed}) 15. Be3 Nde5 $6 {
Once again moving the knight. In general, it is a good idea for the side with
less space to exchange pieces, but here this is too slow} (15... Bb7 16. Rac1 {

Nxe5 Nxe5 17. Rac1 Qb8 18. Bc5 $1 {[pgndiagram] A great decision, exchanging

dominate the bishop on c8} Bxc5 19. Nxc5 Qb6 20. Qh5 Nd7 21. Be2 $6 {Probably
it was stronger not to allow a knight exchange} (21. Nb3 {Came into
consideration here}) 21... g6 {Before exchanging, Black creates "luft" for his
king, which is always useful} 22. Qg5 Nxc5 23. Rxc5 a5 24. h4 {[pgndiagram]
Despite White's slight inaccuracy on move 21, he still has a dominant position
(control of the open files, better minor piece, more space, chances of attack)}

probably wiser not to move the pawns} (25... Rad8 26. Rdc1 Rc8 27. h5 Qd8 28.
Qe3 {And Black has some chances of resisting, although White retains a large
portion of his advantage}) 26. Qe3 {[pgndiagram] Now Black's difficulties
increase further} Rad8 27. Rxd8 Rxd8 $2 {Losing immediately} (27... Qxd8 {Was
more resilient, but as it is..}) 28. e5 $1 {The consequence of 25... f6. White
also takes away the d6 square from the Black Queen} (28. Rc8 Qd6 {Is probably
also winning, though}) 28... f5 $2 {But this loses immediately} (28... Kf7 {Is
the best move according to the engine, but this tells everything about Black's
position} 29. exf6) 29. Rc8 {[pgndiagram] Black loses a full rook, or a queen
for rook. Therefore he resigned. A beautiful positional win in the style of
Capablanca.} 1-0

are not that clear, as Black recaptures on e5 with queen and White loses an

tactical combination flowing from a strategicaly superior position and leading
into a better endgame. The conversion was not that smooth these time, but
Vidmar was unable to endure the tension and cracked under the pressure, like
many of Alekhine's opponents before (and after) him.} 0-1

move. If White takes with the Bishop, Black can exploit the semi-open e-file

handled properly.   And more importantly, fully in accordance with Alekhine's
style} 5. Qa4+ Bd7 6. Qxd4 exd5 7. Qxd5 Nc6 {[pgndiagram] For the pawn Black

Not the best move in this position} (8. Nf3 {Is the modern move}) (8. e3 {Also
has it's points}) 8... Nf6 9. Qd2 h6 $1 {[pgndiagram] The point. White is

Black has the compensation for the pawn, but not more}) 11... O-O-O {Now Black

hurricane of initiative and combinations that started right out of the opening.
