1. e4 $1 {[%c_effect e4;square;e4;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] White can choose
more or less any sensible first move (including 1. e4) in a normal game, or even
a must-win game. e4, d4, Nf3, c4- all strike me as having similar chances of
fighting for an edge. But if one specifically needs a draw with White, 1.e4 is
absolutely the way to do it. Play the most forcing moves $1} 1... c5 2. Nf3 e6 3.
c4 {A bit of a weird move order. c4 only really works against the Kan, but not
against the Taimanov} (3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 {Now c4 would make a lot more
sense. Carlsen played this against Anand in their second match.}) 3... Nc6 4. d4
{Transposing back to the Taimanov} (4. Nc3 {This would have avoided the option
Black chose in the game.}) 4... cxd4 5. Nxd4 Bc5 $1 {[%c_effect
c5;square;c5;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] Definitely the best move under the
circumstances} (5... Nf6 6. Nc3 {Has long been known to end in sterile equality
very quickly. This is not normally a problem from Black's point of view, but
this game is a bit different...} 6... Bb4 7. Nxc6 bxc6 8. Bd3 {The position is
very dry and very safe for White. Neither side has any good plans at their
disposal to imbalance the game.}) 6. Nc2 (6. Nb3 {Is a better chance to fight
for an edge, and White may well be better. But at least Black is keeping some
tension in the game.}) 6... Nf6 7. Nc3 O-O (7... Qb6 {Black absolutely needed to
disrupt White's coordination. after something like} 8. Qd2 Ng4 9. Nd1 O-O 10. h3
Nf6 11. Nc3 {Black is not better, and White can complete his development, but at
least he doesn't have perfect coordination and a nice space advantage.}) 8. Be3
{Now White develops easily and even maintains a nice edge due to his extra space
in the style of the Maroczy bind. My annotations won't be published until the
game ends, but at this point, I find it very unlikely we will see a fourth
game.} 8... b6 9. Be2 Bb7 10. O-O Qe7 11. Qd2 Rfd8 12. Rfd1 {White is incredibly
solid. In such structures the best plan for Black is generall to try to force
d7-d5 through, but all that does is liquidate the position.} 12... Ne5 13. Bxc5
bxc5 14. f4 $1 {[%c_effect f4;square;f4;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] White
takes even more space.} 14... Ng6 15. Qe3 d6 (15... d5 {\"Objectively\" this has
to be the best move, and Black is almost equalizing. But it chops off all the
pieces, and this is obviously unacceptable for Caruana.} 16. exd5 exd5 17. Qxe7
Nxe7 18. cxd5 Nfxd5 19. Nxd5 Nxd5 {I don't think Magnus will lose a position
like this one very often...}) 16. Rd2 a6 17. Rad1 Qc7 18. b3 {White's play is
simple and easy. Just keep everything protected and maintain the space
advantage. Winning the game will not be easy, but his strong play in the first 2
rapid games earned him the right to sit tight here.} 18... h6 19. g3 Rd7 20. Bf3
Re8 21. Qf2 Ne7 22. h3 Red8 {Not much is happening. Black is struggling to find
any kind of active plan.} 23. Bg2 Nc6 24. g4 $1 {[%c_effect
g4;square;g4;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] This is undoubtedly the best move,
and Magnus must be given credit for being willing to somewhat open his king in a
game where a draw clinches the World Championship. White expands his space
advantage further.} 24... Qa5 25. Na4 Qc7 26. e5 (26. g5 $5 {[%c_effect
g5;square;g5;type;Interesting;persistent;true] White could have gone directly
for the king, but one can hardly blame Magnus for looking for simplification and
instand gratification. Had this been game 1, I doubt he would hesitate to play
g5. And he'd likely have won.}) 26... dxe5 27. Nxc5 Rxd2 28. Rxd2 Rxd2 29. Qxd2
Ba8 $1 {[%c_effect a8;square;a8;type;GreatFind;persistent;true]} (29... exf4 30.
Nxb7 Qxb7 31. Qxf4 {Looks very safe for White.}) 30. fxe5 Qxe5 31. Nd7 {This
looks like the easiest way to force a draw. All the pieces come off.} 31... Qb2
(31... Nxd7 32. Qxd7 Qg3 {Almost keeps some fight, but the bishop on a8 is lost
after} 33. Qc8+) 32. Qd6 Nxd7 33. Qxd7 Qxc2 {Caruana makes the right choice to
keep different pieces on the board. White's c-pawn is pretty dangerous and the
bishop is better then the knight in it's abolity to send the pawn through, but
White's king is open and the knight and queen can be a dangerous attacking pair.
White is certainly not worse but Caruana has to take any chance he can get to
imbalance the position at all.} 34. Qe8+ Kh7 35. Qxa8 Qd1+ 36. Kh2 Qd6+ 37. Kh1
Nd4 38. Qe4+ f5 39. gxf5 exf5 40. Qe3 {The g2 bishop is too strong. Its really
hard to imagine how White can get mated.} 40... Ne6 41. b4 $1 {[%c_effect
b4;square;b4;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] Passed pawns must be pushed $1} 41...
Ng5 {Black clearly wants f4-f3- it's his only winning attempt. The move is
objectively bad but in an absolute must-win scenario, you gotta do what you
gotta do.} 42. c5 Qf6 43. c6 {White's c-pawn will decide the game long before
any attack has a dream of coming through.} 43... Ne6 44. a4 Nc7 45. Qf4 Ne6 46.
Qd6 $1 {[%c_effect d6;square;d6;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] going for the 3-0
sweep. Magnus showed why he is one of the best players ever, making one of the
best players in the world (who even fought him to a 6-6 tie in the classical
portion) look completely uncompetitive in the rapid playoff. I was happy to see
him look for complicated positions with the black pieces, and any future
challengers would be best advised to try to beat him in regulation- his rapid
play is absurdly powerful. I'd like to thank chess.com for inviting me to
annotate the games, I did my best to bring the best and most objective analysis
I could, and I hope I was able to shed some light on the games. Thanks to all
for reading $1} (46. Qe3 {One wonders if Caruana would have repeated moves here.
We'll never know because Magnus wanted the whole cake.}) 1-0
